# Title

Git Training with Gerard post mine and George's holidays


# Introduction

I've just got back from holiday and did not fancy doing any real work.
I chatted to my colleagues when I returned and advised that if they want to go to Ireland they consult Bloggs et al 2004 for info.
I do not recommend the Rough Guide to Ireland.

# George's Holiday

GWL went to Madrid with a friend, saw the sites, drank lots of beer, and went to a footie match.

# Methodology

Booked ferry, caught ferry, trugged through Dublin, stayed in a cottage, went sightseeing, came home.

# Conclusions

The West of Ireland is a great place to visit.
