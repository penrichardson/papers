# Title

Git Training with Gerard post mine and George's holidays

# Abstract

Holiday fun in Ireland and Spain (though we mostly ignore the Spain bit).

# Introduction

I've just got back from holiday and did not fancy doing any real work.
I chatted to my colleagues when I returned and advised that if they want to go to Ireland they consult Bloggs et al 2004 for info.
I do not recommend the Rough Guide to Ireland.

# George's Holiday

GWL went to Madrid with a friend, saw the sites, drank lots of beer, and went to a footie match.

# Methodology

Booked ferry, caught ferry, trugged through Dublin, stayed in a cottage, went sightseeing, came home.

# Results

Saw some great countryside and coastal landscapes, drank lots of Irish beer, visited a few museums. Came back to work more relaxed.

# Conclusions

The West of Ireland is a great place to visit. 

# Figures

Managed to consume 48 irish beers from 28 different irish breweries.

# Acknowledgements

My husband for doing all the driving.
